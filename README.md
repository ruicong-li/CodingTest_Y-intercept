# CodingTest_Y-intercept

YIntercept.ipynb is the initial version of the strategy and back-test notebook, focusing the framework and setup.

YIntercept2.ipynb is an extended version with more feature engineering and machine learning models. Most of them have a turnover too high to be profitable. Surprisingly, the neural network model generates low turnover rates. I would look into volatility and its interactions with existing significant features if I had more time. Another direction is to construct cross-momentum or pair-trading strategies derived from the correlation/cointegration between stocks. A simple idea may outperform complicated models.

The HTML notebooks are for easy review of the plots generated by iplot.
